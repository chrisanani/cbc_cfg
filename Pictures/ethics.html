        Counseling principles and ethics 
        1.	Know and accept that you are working for the Lord
        2.	Be committed to counsel as a ministry or calling
        3.	Do not apply pressure for rapid results and do not prolong counseling unduly. [A fruit plucked before ripening or too long after ripening may be useless]
        4.	Exercise a lot of patience
        5.	Never betray confidence; keep secrets or privacy. They may not open up when there is no privacy
        6.	Avoid judgmental words or body language that suggests disapproval of behaviour
        7.	Stick to issues and not personality. [If what was done was foolish it does not mean they are foolish]
        8.	Recognize your limitation and refer [after permission from counselee] hard cases to appropriate persons
        9.	Do not compromise on Christian values at any cost. Do not allow yourself to be ‘converted’ to sin
        10.	Avoid physical contact [apart from a hand shake in greeting], especially with the opposite sex.
        11.	Do not visit or allow visits at “unholy” hours; avoid all appearances of evil
        12.	If possible let closest relative or friend of counselee know your missions. This is to avoid misinterpretation of your mission
        13.	As much as possible avoid counseling the opposite sex all alone unless you have somebody of the same sex as your counselee around to help you, e.g. your spouse or another counselor. Assure counselee that such a helper is also there to help him/her
        14.	Do not allow counselee to cling to you at all cost. They must not take advantage of you or depend on you. Aim at independence for them.
        15.	Never miss the opportunity to lead the counselee to Christ if you find out he/she is not born again.
        16.	Never give the impression that there’s no solution if you in particular could not help. It will be a license for more misbehavior
