    <h1>WHAT COUNSELING IS NOT ABOUT</h1>
    <p>
        <ol>
        
        <li>It is not giving advice although occasionally some Bible-based advice may be given For instance, if confession 
    and acceptance of Christ must occur first, you may advise without insisting on it until conviction by the Holy Spirit 
    is complete. Always make room for a second opinion just as doctors or lawyers allow for opinions. It is better if 
    you can give the alternatives there and then rather asking them to see someone else, or you do the consultation and 
    bring the result at the earliest next opportunity. </li><br>
    <li>It is not telling counselee what to do or not to do. No imposition.</li> <br>
    <li>It is not judging or condemning [Matt. 7: 1-2] e.g. ‘it’s your own fault by going there’ or ‘that’s a foolish choice’.</li> <br>
    <li> It is not preaching and so use few words and don’t dominate the talking. Much will be forgotten after long lectures. </li><br>
    <li> It is not solving counselee’s problems and so don’t get too involved in the solution. </li><br>
    <li> It is not satisfying your curiosity about the counselee or their problem. </li> <br>
    <li> It is not creating guilt, e.g. ‘but oh, why did you go there?’  [there is provision for forgiveness, Isaiah 1:18; 1 Jn. 1:9] </li><br>
    <li> It is not manipulating or interrogating and so mind the framing of your questions or enquiries. </li> <br>
    <li>It is not forcing your ideas or values on another person, leave room for personal choice by counselee. </li> <br>
    <li>It is not satisfying your need to be heard especially when you have no one to hear your personal challenges</li><br>
    <li>It is not to prove a point, e.g. ‘yes, I said it!’ or ‘I thought as much’. </li> <br>
    <li> It is not an opportunity to sound or look impressive. The temptation is high when there is some element of inferiority on your
     part as you counsel some VIP or someone far older than you.</li> <br>
    <li>It is not to draw attention to us but to Christ. No matter how effective you are as counselor or how anointed you are to handle <br>
    the situation, do well to shift attention to Christ at all cost.</li>
   </ol>
