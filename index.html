 <h2>Brief History of Counselling & Follow-Up Ministry of Calvary Baptist Church</h2>
     <p class="brief">
        The group started in 1981 with a few dedicated Christians who felt called to enter  the Counselling and Follow-Up Group ministry. This was during the time of Rev. Alfred Steven-son Williams, who was the head pastor. The current Senior Pastor Rev. Dr. Fred Deegbe, Rev. Tse Amable, Mrs. Corinne Aboagye, and Anna Brew were prominent among the pioneers. In late 1981 Jonathan Apler-Doku now a Deacon and others joined.  Among those who joined later between 1982 and 1983 and are still with the group are Deaconness Mabel Mensah 
         and Rev. Kingsley Osei. <br> <br>

         "With time some of the brethren who have passed through the group came together to form an association of old members which they called (CaBaCA) meaning Calvary Baptist Counsellors Alumini. Members were brought together so we could continue to encourage each other as they work in the vineyard of the Lord and also form a platform to also encourage the current crop of counsellors. <br>
         
         The first elected Executive Committee comprised of Rev. Tse Amable as President, Rev Kingsley Osei as Vice-President, Deacon Jonathan Aplerh-Doku as Secretary, Pastor Julius Aidam as Vice Secretary/Organiser, Deacon Vincent Amuh as Treasurer, Deacon Francis Nyavor as Vice Treasurer, Mrs Grace Baddoo as International Coordinator and Ms Lena Sateklah as Assistant International Coordinator. Rev. Dr. Fred Deegbe is the Patron for CaBaCA  <br> <br>

          Calvary Baptist Church, Shiashie Campus started with few counsellors who moved from Adabraka to serve. These pioneers include Ethel Anamoo, Jemima Wallace, Aklasu Christian, Lena Siaw - Larbi, Rev. Christian Eze Zee, and Ekow Sam. The first officers chosen to lead them were Deacon Daniel Amaning (Co-ordinator), Jessie Bannerman-Wood (Secretary), Cephas Logo (Prayer Secretary), and Ekow Sam (Treasurer).
