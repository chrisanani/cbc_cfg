     Counseling, according to Chambers English Dictionary, is defined as “a service consisting of helping 
     people to adjust to or deal with personal problems, etc. by enabling them to discover for themselves
      the solution to the problems, while receiving sympathetic attention from a counselor”. We can modify
       the above definition and make it Bible-based. Thus Biblical Counseling is “using the word of God to
        help people to <strong>adjust to or deal with personal problems, etc. by enabling them to discover for themselves
          the solution to the problems, while receiving sympathetic attention from a counselor”</strong> <br> <br>

          <h3>KEY WORDS/IMPLICATIONS </h3> <br>
<strong>Helping </strong>  Counseling is basically offering help. It implies that the person to be helped [counselee] must see that he/she has a need. <br> <br> 
<strong>Adjust </strong>  The counselee may be helped to overcome the problem as he/she changes their position in relation to the problem. <br> <br> 
<strong> Deal with </strong>  Note that some problems may only be managed but never removed. They must be faced at all cost. The aim therefore is 
to help the counselee to live with the problem in a more positive way; for instance, a counselee who has lost a loved one can be 
helped to cope with the loss in such a way that life could still go on somehow happily. <br><br> 
<strong> Discover</strong>:  It is not proper for a counselor to just present facts without letting the counselee discover them. The good counselor
leads the counselee to discover by giving some hints on certain facts and by asking relevant questions. All conclusions therefore should, 
 as much as possible, be drawn by the counselee especially where the conclusions are good.
