    <h1> Counseling principles and ethics </h1>
    <p>
        <ol>
           
<li>Know and accept that you are working for the Lord.</li> <br>
<li>Be committed to counsel as a ministry or calling.</li><br>
<li>Do not apply pressure for rapid results and do not prolong counseling unduly.
 [A fruit plucked before ripening or too long after ripening may be useless]</li><br>
<li> Exercise a lot of patience.</li><br>
<li>Never betray confidence; keep secrets or privacy. They may not open up when there is no privacy.</li> <br>
<li>Avoid judgmental words or body language that suggests disapproval of behaviour.</li><br>
<li>Stick to issues and not personality. [If what was done was foolish it does not mean they are foolish].</li> <br>
<li>Recognize your limitation and refer [after permission from counselee] hard cases to appropriate persons. </li><br>
<li>Do not compromise on Christian values at any cost. Do not allow yourself to be ‘converted’ to sin. </li><br>
<li>Avoid physical contact [apart from a hand shake in greeting], especially with the opposite sex.</li><br>
<li>Do not visit or allow visits at “unholy” hours; avoid all appearances of evil.</li> <br>
<li>If possible let closest relative or friend of counselee know your missions. This is to avoid misinterpretation of your mission.</li><br>
<li>As much as possible avoid counseling the opposite sex all alone unless you have somebody of the same sex as your counselee.<br>
    around to help you, e.g. your spouse or another counselor. Assure counselee that such a helper is also there to help him/her.</li><br>
<li>Do not allow counselee to cling to you at all cost. They must not take advantage of you or depend on you. Aim at independence for them.</li><br>
<li>	Never miss the opportunity to lead the counselee to Christ if you find out he/she is not born again.</li><br>
<li>	Never give the impression that there’s no solution if you in particular could not help. It will be a license for more misbehavior.</li><br><br>
</ol>
