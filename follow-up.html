    <h2>Follow–up of Counselees</h2>
     <details>
        <summary>What is Follow – up? <br></summary>
        <p>Follow–up is a process of giving continued attention to new converts or counselees until they are established in Christ Jesus 
            and the Church by finding out, their gifts, developing them and deploying them. Follow–up is not only meant for new converts but 
            also for Christians who visit the Church for the first time. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>Col 1:28-29 <br>
              28 So we tell others about Christ, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all the wisdom God has given us. We want to 
              present them to God, perfect in their relationship to Christ. 29 That's why I work and struggle so hard, depending on Christ's 
              mighty power that works within me.
              <br><br>
              Acts 15:36 <br> 
              Sometime later Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the 
               Lord and see how they are doing." 
            <br> <br>
                
             Col 1:3-4 <br>
            3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, 4 because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints—
            <br>

        <summary>Follow-Up in Four Areas</summary>
        <p>Our Follows are in four areas. They are mostly the counselees we receive. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Personal Saviour.</li> 
            <li>want to join the Church</li> 
            <li>come to rededicate their lives to Christ. </li>
            <li>come for prayer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All these four groups need to be followed – up. The question is, are they all going to be followed – up in the same way? The answer is simply a big NO. Their needs are different. This writeup is to help to bring to the fore these differences and to devise effective ways by which effective follow – up can be made. <br>

            The follow – ups by the counsellors are by two methods namely individual follow–up and mass follow–up. <br> <br>
            
            <b>Individual Follow – up</b> <br>
            The counsellor will within 48hrs make the first contact with the counselee either by phone or by personal visit to the home/Workplace of the counselee. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Mass Follow – up</b> <br><br>
            The ministry organizes mass follow – up to enable personal visits to be made to counselees who weren’t visited in a quarter. The members are put into groups and sent to particular areas where these counselees live. <br>
            
            In all these phone calls or visits, the counsellor will say that “the senior pastor” has sent him/her to the counselee. <br> <br>
            
            <b>What is the importance of Follow – up?</b><br> <br>
            Through follow-up, counselees are encouraged to get closer to God and their self-worth increases. Follow–ups are channels where an individual would be church members receive love, care, attention, nurturing, encouragement, and finally make their decision to stay in the Church or not; (1 Thessalonians 2:7-14). <br>
            
            The mindset of the counsellor in Follow-up is to mature them in Christ. <br>
            <em>28 So we tell others about Christ, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all the wisdom God has given us. We want to present them to God, perfect in their relationship to Christ. 29 That's why I work and struggle so hard, depending on Christ's mighty power that works within me. Col 1:28-29.<br>
            </em> <br>
            One other reason why Follow -up is important, is that as newborn babies or visitors who come to the Church, they may not be familiar with and also not have friends in the Church so through Follow – up, they can strike a friendship with the counsellor. <br>
            Through prayer and teaching we are to protect them from that evil one, Satan the devil, from his deception and discouragement; (1 Samuel 17:34-36; Jeremiah 23:4). <br><br>
            
            What qualities do the counsellor need to do effective Follow -up? - John 10:1-16.<br>
            <ul><li>Must earn the role as a Counsellor vrs 1 - 2</li> <br>
                <li>Ability to instruct and lead the sheep/Counselee</li> <br>
                <li>Availability</li> <br>
                <li>Ability to provide food for the counselee/sheep</li> <br>
                <li>Ability to bring lost sheep back to the fold</li>
            </ul>  <br>

    <summary>What does Follow – up involve?</summary>  <br>
<p><b>Visit</b> <br>
    In visits, we mean the counsellor makes an appointment with the counselee and honours it by going to the agreed venue of the counselee either in their homes or places of work or any convenient place of the counselee. <br>
    <br>
   <b>Phone calls</b> <br>
    As the name suggests, the counsellor will make a personal call to the counselee within 48hrs of counselling.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Prayer</b> <br>
    At the time of counselling, the counsellor might observe certain things about the counselee as well as the prayer request, he/she made put all these into prayer on behalf of the counselee,
    <br><br>
    2 Thess 2:13-14
    <em>13 But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and belief in the truth. 14 He called you to this through our gospel,
         that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. </em> <br>
     <ul>
    <li>When you call a counselee, you will say the senior Pastor has asked me to call you and to find out how you are doing.</li> <br>
    
   <li> When you visit, the senior pastor has sent you to personally visit.</li> <br>
    
    <li>Decline food, drink etc politely except for water. Better still you hold your bottled water to the house of your counselee. </li>
