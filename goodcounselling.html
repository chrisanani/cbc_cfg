    <h1>WHAT COUNSELING IS ABOUT</h1>
    <p>
        <ol>
            
<li>It is helping [somebody find solution], e.g. helping from behind [such as pushing a car] and helping from the front [such as leading a way to a place].</li> <br>
<li>It is making someone feel accepted [unconditionally]. It might not be so much as what you say but the environment that you create that makes the person feel accepted even in that unpleasant state where they could be blamed for the mess.</li> <br>
<li>It is a process even if it is short. Don’t be in a hurry to see results and don’t rush through sessions with the aim of getting instant results.</li> <br>
<li>It is a time to show sympathy, love, concern and understanding. When a person is convinced he/she is understood, loved, etc. they can manage better their challenge.</li> <br>
<li>It is creating an avenue for counselee to comprehend his/her problem or challenge or venture. This is when you should be resourced enough to help bring out other sides of issues they may not know or understand or have neglected. </li> <br>
<li>It is leading a person to have faith and confidence in Christ in the midst of the challenge or fear</li> <br>
<li>It is bringing out the good in a person. No matter how down the person feels, they must know that being God’s creation means they have some good in them. It is not late until it is late.</li> <br>
<li>It is bringing out information through assisted discovery. Avoid being the direct source of information since discovery has some element of excitement and the information tends to stick better than when it was just given by someone else.</li> <br>
<li>It is equipping counselee to handle his/her own problems. Some of the equipping could be helping them to know how to do Quiet Time, fast and pray, study or routinely read the Bible</li> <br>
<li>It is encouraging them to press on especially if it is obvious they have a long way to go, 1 Thess. 5:14; Heb. 12:12.</li> <br>
<li>It is reasoning with them to come to good conclusions. This means they must have input in your discussion or talking</li> <br> 
<li>It is sharing their burden or joy without taking over and you also making them share in your experiences in Christ.</li> <br>

            </ol>
