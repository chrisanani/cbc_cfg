     <h2>DIRECTION</h2>
     <p>
        The group has gone through many transformations. One of its paramount concerns has been to have a 
        group whose members are fully committed to the Lord, demonstrated by holy living and full participation 
        in the Groupâ€™s activities. Our focus can be summarised below. 
     </p>
      
     
    <ol>
     <li>To provide counselling for new converts who come to accept Christ Jesus as Lord and Saviour.</li> <br>
     <li>To counsel and help people who make other decisions such as rededication, transfer of membership, joining the church, assurance of Salvation etc.</li><br>
     <li>To help establish all people counselled by the group.</li><br>
     <li>To foster Christian fellowship, spiritual growth and Christian maturity among counselees.</li><br>
     <li>To serve as a link between the church and new converts, especially baptised church members.</li><br>
